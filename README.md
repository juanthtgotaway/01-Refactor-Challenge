## Description 
In this project upon looking and using the website there were some things that could have been condensed and cleaned up. Links were broken and some elements missing thus intriguing me to see if I could correct the existing code. Along the way fixing all the items mentioned above there were a lot of learning curves such as the following:
**In HTML:** there was small but noticible items missing such as the title element so that users can see the name on a browser tab. There was a rough nav bar attempt but it was not properly written so the item wasnt correctly coded. Furthermore, the link for 'search engine optimization' was broken so having to rewrite the code so it worked was also a trick within itself. Along the way making sure my code followed the same styles (img, header, and paragraph) throughout so it had some flow/consistency. Lastly, adding the proper footer section. 
**In CSS:** the biggest challenge was trying to condense all the lines down considering so many styles were repeated along the way. Running the windows inspect tool to see what would work and making sure what would work and what wouldnt.
Overall there was lots of trial and error along the way to make sure this code was corrected and would work like it was supposed to.
